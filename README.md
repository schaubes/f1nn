# F1NN - Formula 1 Neural Network

The idea is to get an understanding of neural networks and predict the next race outcome.

#### Prerequisites

These packages are required:

- pytorch
- tensorflow
- fastf1
- pandas

For now, only pytorch is implemented. In the future, you should be able to choose which nn library you want to use.
